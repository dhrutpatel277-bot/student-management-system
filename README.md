# Student Management System (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Management System** is a Java-based console application designed to manage student records efficiently. The system allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete student information using a menu-driven interface. It demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and basic data management techniques suitable for real-world applications.

This project was developed as part of my coursework and personal practice to strengthen my understanding of Java, data structures, and problem-solving.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the project in a Java IDE
3. Compile all `.java` files
4. Run `Main.java`
5. Follow on-screen menu instructions

---

## 🖥️ Sample Workflow

1. Choose an option from the menu
2. Enter student details when prompted
3. Perform operations like search, update, or delete
4. Exit the program safely

## ✅ Assumptions & Limitations

* Student ID must be unique
* Data is stored temporarily during program execution
* Console-based interface (no GUI)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* File handling for permanent data storage
* Sorting students by GPA or name
* GUI version using JavaFX or Swing
* Role-based access (Admin/User)

---

## 📚 What I Learned

* Designing a complete menu-driven application
* Applying OOP principles to real problems
* Handling user input and validation
* Structuring a Java project professionally
